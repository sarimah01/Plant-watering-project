# Plant-watering-project

#INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this project is to create an automated system that can water a plant. I plan to do
this using my laptop (java) and an Arduino board, MOSFET and a water pump. The system will
be capable of running over multiple days and should only pump water to the plant when the soil
is dry.
